### 20 System Design Concepts:

- Vertical scaling (add more resources)
- Horizontal scaling (replicas) Complicated>>>
- Load balancers (balance traffic) round robin
- CDN (serve files regionwise -> caching)
- Caching (copies so that refetch faster)
- IP Address
- TCP/IP, UDP (protocols to send data)
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- HTTP
- REST
- GraphQL (by FB) single request i.e Query
- gRPC (by Google) improvent over REST, Protocol buffers
- WebSocket (bidirectional comm)
- SQL
- ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- NoSQL (no relations) key-value, graph, document databases
- Sharding \*(divide database on different machines)
- Replication
- CAP thrm (Consistency Availability we can achieve only one)
- Message queues
